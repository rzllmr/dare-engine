This is the first package I assembled now with a very simple demo level. But it can be deployed as it is to itch.io or any other server hosting it as a webpage. And while the code is bundled to a tight package, the content files relevant to the game are still open and editable. So you can just go ahead and fiddle around with it. Have fun!
