# Dare Game Template
> A game template for you to fiddle with.

Did you ever think of making a game? If not you don't need to read further.

But otherwise you can just start here and now. Mess around with the files you find in this package and see what happens. You can alter everything to your liking to have your first own game content in mere minutes. And with a little practice and patience even a whole little game of your own you can play and share. So, go on, just try it...

## How to start

The first thing you need to know is how to run the game. Because it needs to be served as a webpage, you need a little program to do that for you. Please install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to your system and execute _run.bat_/_run.command_ to get going. In your favorite browser you will then find the game at http://localhost:3000.

With the game running you can just change some of the files, reload the page and see what it does. Or head to the [homepage](https://rzllmr.github.io/pixi-engine/) to get an explanation for the different aspects. What the files are for, how they need to be handled and what features they provide with just a few lines of text.

## File structure

A broad outline of the files within this packages and what they're for you get here:

* __content__ _// folder you want to fiddle with_
* __fonts__ _// the game's font files_
* __images__ _// all the artwork used throughout the game_
* __styles__ _// stylesheets defining the game's layout and ui_
* __*.bundle.js__ _// tightly packed source code files_
* __favicon.png__ _// icon for the browser tab_
* __index.html__ _// webpage running the game_
* __MIT License__ _// license for the code files_
* __README.md__ _// this file you're reading_
* __version.txt__ _// current game version_

## How to share

Let's assume you're poised and proud with the game you made and want to show it to others. Then you just need a server to serve it to them on their mobile. You have none? That's ok, because [itch.io](https://itch.io/) can help you out. Log in there and follow their [guide](https://itch.io/docs/creators/html5) to set up a page for your game. Zip this directory and upload it there to have it playable for everybody stumbling over your page. I did it the same way with this project [here](https://rzllmr.itch.io/dare).

And let me know you did that - in a comment for example. I'm always happy to see what other people come up with starting from this little template.
